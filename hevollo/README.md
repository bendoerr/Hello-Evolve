## DNA

* String a-Z0-9
* Each 5-10 characters forms a gene. Possible genes: Base longevity, color, color preference, ability to eat.
* Each character is numberd a=1, b=2, A=27, 0=53, 9=62. The characters in a gene are added up to produce a number that can fall in a trait range. 10 being the minimum and 620 the max. 305 being the middle and numbers around it the most common. 

## Genes & Traits
**Base Longevity**

* *10-200* 3 generations
* *201-419* 4 generations
* *420-620* 5 generations

The idea is that when the organism is born, it gets this base life before it dies. Things like not eating during a generation can reduce this. 

**Strength**

* *10-200* 60% chance of eating
* *201-419* 75% chance of eating
* *420-620* 90% chance of eating

During each generation the organism needs to eat. If it doesn't eat it losses one generation from it's life.

**Color**

* *10-200* Red
* *201-249* Orange
* *250-299* Yellow
* *300-310* Green
* *311-360* Blue
* *361-419* Indigo
* *420-620* Violet

Organisms can only reproduce with other same color organisms or organisms of a color adjacent on the list. 

**Color Preference**
Chance Organisms will choose the same color even if there is an organism with an adjacent color with a higher fitness

## Fitness

I guess fitness would be determined by longevity and strength.. hmm there should be one more thing in here. Fitness will be used only for choosing a mate.
